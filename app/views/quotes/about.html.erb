  <h1>About Splurty</h1>

  <p>
  Splurty was built by Buttercats. Two web developers who are on a mission to give people the technical skills needed to launch their own cats and turn ideas into butter.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Together they taught hundreds of buttercats how to melt and build buttery that people want at places like Harvard Butter School, Carnegie Melty, Rhode Island School of Cats, and Brown Butter University.
